<h1>Employee Management System with SAP Hana</h1>  

<p>We designed an e-profile application that displays and maintains the details of career history, organizational commitments, 
and accomplishments for all the employees associated with the organization. The idea is to have this application give a quick 
glimpse of an employeeâ€™s profile, which helps both, socially as well as workwise the company to develop a better understanding 
of the employee. Also to develop an SAP Fiori application, with a well-tailored UI for an efficient work organization and 
management system. </p>

The idea involved pertaining to this application is to organize and schedule the tasks assigned to him/her, with the following features:

1)	The employee will assign priorities to the tasks as assigned (from less priority to highly critical).
2)	The application will help an employee schedule the tasks based on his work schedule (with hourly, daily or monthly recurrences). A prompt must appear depicting the list of tasks, with reminders or alarms upon the occurrence of an event.
3)	A graph or chart depicting the time devoted to the tasks based on the categories can be integrated with this app for faster analysis on task and time tracking.
